            <section id="about" aria-label="About me">
                <p>I’ve had quite a diverse career history. I worked in costume departments within the live entertainment industry for 20 years. Working in live theatre has honed my ability to grasp the overall scope of a project, whilst collaborating with multiple teams. Thanks to the covid lockdowns, I took time to study <b>Graphic Design</b>, having recently completing my degree.</p>
                <p>I’m grateful we touched on <b>interactive design</b>, as this subject introduced me to front-end development. Back to the classroom, I joyfully returned.</p> 
                <p>I am still learning and proud of the work I produce. This website is a personal example of "inspired by many, made by me".</p>
                <p>My career goal is to empower a client's brand by blending web design and digital storytelling. I can do this by utilizing my skills developed in the creative industry and those recently gained.</p>
