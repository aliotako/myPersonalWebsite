            <section id="about" aria-label="About me">
             <p class="mb-4">I’ve had quite a diverse career history. I worked in the costume/wardrobe department within the live entertainment industry for 20 years. Working in live theatre honed my ability to grasp the overall scope of a project, while collaborating with multiple teams. Thanks to the covid lockdowns, I took time to study Graphic Design, recently completing my degree. <br>
             I’m grateful we touched on interactive design, as this subject introduced me to front-end development. Back to the classroom, I returned. <br>
             I am still learning and proud of the work I produce. This website is a personal example of "inspired by many, made by me". <br>             
             My goal is to empower client brands by blending web design and digital storytelling. Working in a dog-friendly environment is second on the list.
